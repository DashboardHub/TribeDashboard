# TribeDashboard

An Open Source Dashboard for my social tribe. A simple and FREE dashboard that displays my GitHub, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram tribe (subscribers / followers etc). With the ability to upgrade to PRO that gives the history of how your tribe has changed today since yesterday and to see historically who has unsubscribe / unfollowed.

## Project guidelines

- Use issues for **epics** and **stories**. **Epics** are high level and **stories** are epics broken down into actual work actions. Use the **epics** and **stories** to discuss high level and more details respectively 
- **Stories** should be branched from `develop` with the issue as the name (e.g. `issue-123`) and go via a **pull request** and be reviewed by another team member. Once merged, branches are to be deleted
- **Stories** should be placed on the **sprint** milestone and the **project** board where they can be progressed (the smaller the better, ideally bite size and less that 1 day)
- **Commits** should have the `angular` [changelog](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md) style **commits** and contain the issue number 

   Commit message example `feat(twitter): #123 My changes are ...`

- `master` automatically deploys to **production** and `develop` automatically deploys to **develop**
